# Bulk-RNA-Seq-anlaysis 

In line with Ratliff lab mission in advancing our understanding of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) through the characterization of a robust mouse model, an in vitro study has been conducted.  This comprehensive effort encompasses both cell line development and in-depth tumor phenotypic analysis. Crucially, this work involves multiple studies aimed at testing the distinct transcriptomic signature of NEPC. To this end, we have successfully conducted a series of sequential investigations using both bulk RNA sequencing in vitro and in vivo models. 

My contribution to this important research: Rigorous analysis of the data and the creation of informative figures for our forthcoming publication. 

Note: scripts relevant to in-vitro study has been uploaded in this repository.
